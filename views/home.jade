          | Attribute files are regular 
          a(href="http://coffeescript.org") CoffeeScript
          |  files, appropriately suffixed 
          code .coffee

            a(href="https://github.com/bevry/cson") CSON

          | ; a variation of 
          a(href="http://www.json.org/") JSON
          |  that allows you to, among other things, make use of 
          a(href="http://coffeescript.org/#strings") comments

          a(href="http://coffeescript.org/#strings") string interpolation
          | , 
          a(href="http://coffeescript.org/#literals") function values

          a(href="http://coffeescript.org/#conditionals") ternary
          |  and 
          a(href="http://coffeescript.org/#switch") switch statements
          | . These features make it a more versatile alternative to 
          a(href="http://www.yaml.org/") YAML
          | .
        p
          | It is recommended to take advantage of these features to achieve,
          | as close as possible, the overall goal of 
          strong
            a(href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself") DRY
            |  (Don’t Repeat Yourself)
          |  and readability. Strive to simplify the job of an
          | application maintainer who will only want to look in a single place
          | to change any attribute value generated by the devops scripts.
        p
          | There are times when it is appropriate for an attribute to be 
          | defined in more than one place. Borg knows which value to use 
          | in these cases because it merges attribute files in a specific 
          | order at runtime. For example, your attribute definitions will 
          | override any defaults provided by third-party submodules. 
        p
          | The resulting attribute values are accessible to all scripts 
          | from within the 
          code @server
          |  variable, which is also pretty printed 
          | to the debug log at the beginning of each run.

        +section('Attribute Precedence')
        p
          | Although it may seem straightforward, when making changes its 
          | important to be sure any changes to attribute values won’t be 
          | accidentally overridden. To help illustrate both the various 
          | locations where attributes can be defined, and the order that 
          | they get merged to produce the final result, we’ve assembled 
          | the handy chart below, in order of precedence:
        table
          thead: tr
            th Name, Location, Precedence

                  | of attributes defined elsewhere--such as in a
                  | concatenation operation, or a hashing operation, or any

                  | Defining constants or overriding attributes within the

                  | difficult for other users to change these and remain
                  | compatible with your upstream. The only exception is
                  | when a script author is certain the resulting output is
                  | unlikely to be a desired change.
                p
                  | As it happens, most scripts end up 100% hard-coded as
                  | a convenience for authors in a hurry to get testing and building
                  | servers. However, these aren't useful for sharing publicly
                  | until all values are abstracted as overridable attributes.

        p

          | global:
          |   aws_security_groups: -> [ @server.env +’-’+ @server.type ]

        +section('Common')
        p
          | There is a third-party submodule that comes with every new 
          code borg init
          |  and that is the borg-scripts/resources repository. It holds the 
          | most basic functions you would expect to use in any project.
        p
          | Notice that these are kept very light-weight. The list is 
          | short but they do a lot by themselves. The preference though is 
          | very biased toward bash scripting muscle. In the author’s 
          | opinion, it makes more sense for three reasons:
        ol
          li
            | Someone not familiar with borg but who is familiar with bash 
            | could more readily read / QA a borg script and copy/paste from 
            | it to achieve the same outcome.
          li
            | Typically the process for making a new script involves first 
            | making the server manually, which results in a bash history 
            | which is used as a template for the devops script. It saves 
            | time to be able to simply paste the bash history into Borg, 
            | rather than have to translate it to yet another domain 
            | specific language (DSL), and back out to bash when 
            | debugging/troubleshooting.
          li
            | Well-written bash script tends to be terse and powerful, 
            | resulting in far less boilerplate and complexity than the 
            | equivalent heavy resource.
          p
            | Also notice that at the moment they’re all targeting Ubuntu
            | server exclusively. Although its half-expected that resources 
            | will all be converted to an OS-agnostic version in the future, 
            | the author hasn’t had any immediate need for it, yet. Expect 
            | it to be added sooner if someone will volunteer the pull request.
